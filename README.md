# Closest Pair of Points
Closest Pair Problem in 3D using Divide and Conquer

## Description
This program is solving Closest Pair Problem in 3D using Divide and Conquer algorithm. Program solve by recursively dividing sorted points by
x coordinates into two. Each part of division will find its distance. In the end, program will combine all distance and find the smallest distnace.

## Requirements
* Python 3.8.5 or later
* Matplotlib 

## Run Program
* Run main.py in src folder on terminal by typing `python main.py`
